    <h2>What is Ice Cream?</h2>
      <p> According to Wikipedia, ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured 
      with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as 
      strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below 
      the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
      It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, 
      semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable 
      as its temperature increases.
