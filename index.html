   <h2>What is Ice Cream?</h2>
   <p> According to Wikipedia, ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener,
     either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring
      is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air 
      spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen 
      together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable 
      as its temperature increases.
      Ice cream is a dessert beloved by millions around the world. This webpage contains information about different types of ice cream, 
      and the profitability of different flavors.</p>
