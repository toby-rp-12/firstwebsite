            <li>Mixing: The main ingredients, including cream, sugar, and flavorings, are mixed together.</li>
            <li>Pasteurization: The mixture is heated to kill any harmful bacteria.</li>
            <li>Homogenization: The mixture is processed to create a smooth texture by breaking down fat molecules.</li>
            <li>Cooling: The mixture is rapidly cooled to prepare it for freezing.</li>
            <li>Freezing: The mixture is churned while being frozen to incorporate air and create a creamy texture.</li>
            <li>Hardening: The ice cream is placed in a hardening cabinet to allow it to freeze completely.</li>
            <li>Packaging: The ice cream is packaged into containers and stored at low temperatures until it is ready to be sold.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Full History of Ice Cream (Wikipedia)</h2>
        <p>Here is a short history of ice cream, taken from <a href="https://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
        <p><span class="wikipedia">The origins of frozen desserts are obscure, although several accounts exist about their history. Some sources say the history of ice cream begins in Persia in 550 BC.

A Roman cookbook dating back to the 1st century includes recipes for sweet desserts that are sprinkled with snow, and there are Persian records from the 2nd century for sweetened drinks chilled with ice.

Kakigōri is a Japanese dessert made with ice and flavoured syrup. The origins of kakigōri date back to the Heian period in Japanese history, when blocks of ice saved during the colder months would be shaved and served with sweet syrup to the Japanese aristocracy during the summer. Kakigōri's origin is referred to in The Pillow Book, a book of observations written by Sei Shōnagon, who served the Imperial Court during the Heian period.

The earliest known written process to artificially make ice is known not from culinary texts, but the 13th-century writings of Syrian historian Ibn Abi Usaybi'a in his book "Kitab Uyun al-anba fi tabaqat-al-atibba" (Book of Sources of Information on the Classes of Physicians) concerning medicine in which Ibn Abi Usaybi'a attributes the process to an even older author, Ibn Bakhtawayhi, of whom nothing is known.

Ice cream production became easier with the discovery of the endothermic effect. Prior to this, cream could be chilled easily but not frozen. The addition of salt lowered the melting point of ice, drawing heat from the cream and allowing it to freeze."</span></p>
